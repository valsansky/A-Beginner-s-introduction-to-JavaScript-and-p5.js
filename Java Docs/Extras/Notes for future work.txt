- Missing Coding Practice for Functions
- Add possible coding solutions for the coding practices in attachments.
- Maybe add pictures of final code outputs for the coding practices for visual examples.
- Everything needs to be read through thoroughly
- Add an OOP section and other relevant more advanced programming topis.
- Potentially update our interactive challenge system (with \newenvironment), to also save answers, and automatically write them in attachments.

There's a couple of temporary formating \clearpage elements throughout the document.
These can be removed. It's just so the document looks better.
Use CTRL+f and search " Temporary Formatting ".

We use three types of "interactive challenges". 
The numbers are generated automatically. Make sure to update the answer numbers in attachments, if your adding new challenges.
    1. Exercises
        Very small tasks that's primarily meant to strengthen the understanding of the topics.

        Use:
        \begin{exercise}[title]
            % exercise text. For example a list of thought exercises.
        \end{exercise}
    
    2. Coding practices
        At the end of all sections. They are typically larger and involve coding an actual program.

        Use:
        \begin{practice}
            % Description of the desired program.
        \end{practice}

    3. Mini projects
        Larger projects at the end of the entire document, meant to strengthen the readers skills in coding, 
        using and combining different parts of programming.

        Use:
        \begin{project}[title]
            % Description of the desired program.
        \end{practice}
